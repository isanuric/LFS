The CIE 1931 color spaces are the first defined quantitative links between physical pure colors (i.e. wavelengths) in the electromagnetic
visible spectrum, and physiological perceived colors in human color vision. The mathematical relationships that define these color spaces
are essential tools for color management. They allow one to translate different physical responses to visible radiation in color inks, 
illuminated displays, and recording devices such as digital cameras into a universal human color vision response. CIE 1931 RGB color
space and CIE 1931 XYZ color space were created by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931. The CIE XYZ color
space was derived from a series of experiments done in the late 1920s by William David Wright[3] and John Guild. Their experimental 
results were combined into the specification of the CIE RGB color space, from which the CIE XYZ color space was derived.
